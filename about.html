                    <h3><br/>About PeachTeach</h3>
                    
					<p>PeachTeach is an educational platform designed to give both students and teachers a user-friendly educational experience which takes into account the strengths and challenges of the Georgia education system and IT infrastructure.<br/>
                        
                    <br/>In addition to an augmented version of the content training available to students, PeachTeach: Teacher Edition includes comprehension and pedagogy skill checks at the end of each module. Comments from other teachers help new and seasoned computer science educators build on their teaching skills to offer a better experience to students in the classroom.<br/></p>
                    
                    <h3><br/>Our Problem</h3>
                    
					<p>There is a shortage of qualified computer science teachers because those with CS degrees do not usually go into education, and other teachers typically lack CS content and pedagogy knowledge. We hoped to create a pathway for math or computer skill teachers to learn how to teach CS, even if they do not have a background in computing.<br/><br/>
                    
                    By providing an online platform which both teachers and students can use to learn content, where teachers can find more detailed information and support from other CS teachers, we wish to connect likeminded teachers who wish to improve the lives of their students and provide a community in addition to an educational platform.
