                            <h3>What is PeachTeach?</h3>
                            <p>PeachTeach is an online educator training service that aims to increase access to computer science education for educators, and therefore students. By going through step-by-step training modules focused on the most-asked-about topics from students, teachers will be exposed to computer science from a very similar viewpoint as their students.<br/><br/><br/></p>

                            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                            <p>PecahTeach focuses on teaching educators who would like to teach computer science, but have no prior experience in the field, just like 70% of high school computer science teachers. We focus not only on teaching teachers computer science, but teaching teachers <b>how to teach computer science</b>. Why? Because the best way to master a skill is by teaching it to someone else.</p>

                    <h3>What's in the future of PeachTeach?</h3>
                    <p>Plans are in the works for PeachTeach to attract corporate sponsors such as Google and Apple to provide the infrastructure necessary for startup. With support from the Georgia Department of Education, we hope to provide teachers with incentives, bonuses, and career-improving credentials to really motivate them to take up this service.<br/><br/>

                    Once the infrastructure is in place, we hope to recruit education professionals, experienced tech personnel, and current CS professors/teachers to build the initial curriculum using cutting-edge pedagogy research.
